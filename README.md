# My dotfile collection
Dotfiles and configuration for my Linux and macOS machines.

In order to get started and to configure these dotfiles to your machines I have written a shell script that makes setting up so much easier.
This script is currently only available for Linux! The macOS one will be available soon.

I stopped using [homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick) to organise and sync all the dotfiles between the machines because I felt I had little control over what I actually want from syncing my dotfiles.

Most of my `.vimrc` was inspired from other people, they are far too many to list them all here. So a silent thank you to all of them.

Hope this helps anyone!
