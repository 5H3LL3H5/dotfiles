# My dotfile collection
Dotfiles and configuration for my work and home machines.

I use (homeshick)[https://github.com/andsens/homeshick] to organise and sync all the dotfiles between the machines. You can also use (homesick)[https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick] which is written in Ruby. Homeshick is just easier to set up for new machines as it is written in bash.

Most of my `.vimrc` was inspired from other people, but they are far too many to list them all here. So a silent thank you to all of them.

Hope this helps anyone!
